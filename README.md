**********************************************
Kyub allows users to create sturdy objects by stacking volumetric elements, 
which we call boxels. 
(a) A single boxel can withstand >500kg of load, 
(b) Added boxels merge automatically, resulting in a larger, yet equally strong structure. 
(c) While kyub offers the affordance of a voxel-based editor, its objects are not bound to a grid; 
users can reshape them using a wide range of deformation tools.
